# cmorlet-tensorflow

A Tensorflow implementation of the continuous wavelet transform obtained via the complex morlet wavelet. Please see the demo Jupyter Notebook for an example of how it is used. This implementation is aimed to leverage GPU acceleration for the computation of the CWT in tensorflow models.
