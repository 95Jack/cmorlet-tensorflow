# cmorlet-tensorflow

A Tensorflow implementation of the Continuous Wavelet Transform obtained via the complex Morlet wavelet. Please see the demo Jupyter Notebook for a demonstration of how it is used. This implementation is aimed to leverage GPU acceleration for the computation of the CWT in tensorflow models.
